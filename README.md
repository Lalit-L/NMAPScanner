# NMAPScanner
A simple NMAP scanner developed in Python

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Edit 1: Added a basic input system that takes in the address that should be scanned

Thoughts: Overall pretty simple, no problems at all

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Edit 2: Added a SYN ACK scan. This performs a SYN ACK scan on the address provided by the user. It also checks for open ports (between ports 1 and 10000), and checks whether or not the address given is up or down. It also provides the protocols being scanned

Thoughts: It was pretty interesting to learn about the different types of scans that exist, as my classes never really went over things like this. It took a while to learn how to go about coding it, but it was pretty fun!
